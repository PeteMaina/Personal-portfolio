# Future Projects & Career Roadmap

This document outlines high-impact projects designed to showcase senior-level expertise in Software Engineering, AI/ML, and Full-Stack Development. These projects are curated to impress startups and tech giants alike.

## [ ] Project 1: "AgriPulse AI" - Real-time Crop Health Monitoring
**Goal**: Build a scalable platform that uses satellite imagery (or drone data) and computer vision to predict crop yields and detect pests early.

### Technical Details:
- **Core**: Python (FastAPI), React, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- **AI/ML**: CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) for image classification. Use transfer learning with models like ResNet or EfficientNet.
- **Features**:
    - Interactive map using Mapbox/Leaflet to show crop health heatmaps.
    - Automated PDF reports for farmers with actionable insights.
    - Integration with weather APIs to provide context-aware predictions.
- **Visualization**: A sleek dashboard with a dark theme, displaying a 3D globe or map with glowing polygons representing fields. Use Chart.js or D3.js for "Health over time" line charts.

## [ ] Project 2: "MedPredict" - Predictive Health Analytics Dashboard
**Goal**: An AI system that analyzes patient records (anonymized) to predict the likelihood of chronic diseases (like Diabetes or Hypertension) using clinical data.

### Technical Details:
- **Core**: Next.js, Django, PostgreSQL.
- **AI/ML**: Random Forest or XGBoost for structured data prediction. Implement SHAP values for explainability (telling the user *why* the AI made that prediction).
- **Features**:
    - Secure "Doctor Portal" with role-based access control.
    - Risk score visualization using gauge charts.
    - Automated appointment suggestions based on patient risk level.
- **Visualization**: Clean, medical-grade UI. High-contrast cards for patient stats. A "Risk Gauge" that moves dynamically and changes color from green to red based on AI confidence.

## [ ] Project 3: "DevSync AI" - Multi-user Collaborative IDE
**Goal**: A real-time collaborative code editor (like VS Code Live Share) with a built-in AI assistant for code completion and debugging.

### Technical Details:
- **Core**: Node.js, Socket.io (for real-time synchronization), Monaco Editor (the core of VS Code).
- **AI/ML**: Integration with OpenAI API (GPT-4) or a self-hosted LLM (like Llama 3) for the chat assistant.
- **Features**:
    - Real-time cursors with user names.
    - Syntax highlighting for 20+ languages.
    - Built-in terminal (simulated or via Docker).
- **Visualization**: A professional, code-centric UI. Sidebar with file tree, bottom panel for AI chat, and a glowing "Focus Mode" that hides everything except the code.

## [ ] Project 4: "FinVision" - Smart Personal Finance Optimizer
**Goal**: An app that categorizes transactions automatically and uses time-series forecasting to predict next month's spending.

### Technical Details:
- **Core**: React Native (for mobile), FastAPI, MongoDB.
- **AI/ML**: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks for spending forecasting.
- **Features**:
    - Bank API integration (using Plaid or similar).
    - Intelligent saving goals based on spending patterns.
    - Receipt scanning using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
- **Visualization**: Modern "Glassmorphism" UI. Vibrant gradients for spending categories. Interactive bar charts that show "Projected vs Actual" spending.

## How to use this roadmap:
1. **Focus on one at a time**: Choose the one that aligns most with your current interests (e.g., Project 1 if you want to double down on AgriTech AI).
2. **Document the process**: Blogs or social posts about your progress are as valuable as the code itself.
3. **Open Source it**: Host it on GitHub with a comprehensive README, setup instructions, and architecture diagrams.
